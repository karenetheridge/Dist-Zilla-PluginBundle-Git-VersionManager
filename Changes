Revision history for Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Git-VersionManager

0.002     2017-09-08 01:26:11Z
          - add mention of [MetaProvides::Update] in unrolled plugin list
          - plugins used by the bundle are now injected into develop-suggests
            prerequisites, rather than develop-requires, so Travis no longer
            feels obliged to install them when testing the built distribution

0.001     2017-08-27 00:30:08Z
          - Initial release, extracted out of
            Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-ETHER-0.129.
